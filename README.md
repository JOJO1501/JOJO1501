Hello and welcome to my profile. My name is Jean Pierre-Joseph and I'm a computer science student, more precisely in the "Software Engineering" field. 

I'm passionate about web and mobile development and AI.
It would be a pleasure for me to share with you some of the projects I'm working on, and to collaborate on others.
I look forward to meeting you!


Let's work together for a better world!

See you soon!
